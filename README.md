#EventLite

Deployed at: [https://eventlite-28189.herokuapp.com/](https://eventlite-28189.herokuapp.com/).

EventLite is a simple event planning demo site built in Ruby on Rails. Create an account with a dummy email address, or log in as one of the sample users (e.g. `test@test.com`, `ex@example.com` or `foo@bar.com`).

Users can create new events that are either public or private. Any user may join public events, but only invited users may join private events.

This was built as an exercise for The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at [http://www.theodinproject.com](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/).
